# 🩺 MediMind AI
### Intelligent AI-Powered Medical Report Analysis & Clinical Decision Support System

MediMind AI is an end-to-end AI healthcare application that analyzes medical laboratory reports, extracts structured clinical information, performs evidence-based interpretation using Large Language Models (LLMs), and enables users to interact with their reports through Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

The project demonstrates modern AI engineering practices including FastAPI, React, ChromaDB, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), OCR-based PDF parsing, semantic search, and LLM integration.

> **Disclaimer:** MediMind AI is designed for educational purposes and clinical decision support. It is **not** a replacement for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.

#  Features

##  Medical Report Analysis

- Upload laboratory reports in PDF format
- Automatic report type detection
- CBC (Complete Blood Count) analysis
- Liver Function Test (LFT) analysis
- Structured parameter extraction
- Automatic reference range comparison
- High / Low / Normal classification
- AI-generated clinical summary

---

##  AI Medical Report Chat

Users can ask natural language questions such as:

- Are my liver enzymes normal?
- Which values are abnormal?
- Explain my CBC report.
- What does high bilirubin indicate?

The AI answers using only information extracted from the uploaded report.

---

##  Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

The application retrieves evidence from a curated medical knowledge base before generating responses.

Knowledge sources include:

- Clinical Guidelines
- Medical Reference Documents
- Laboratory Interpretation Resources

Responses are grounded in retrieved evidence instead of relying only on the language model.
